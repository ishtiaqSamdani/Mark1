## What is this?
* First, simply visit [this page](https://phanindra-max.github.io/xxx-hurray/) and play on simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game and comeback.
* Next, please go ahead and check out the website first and play that game and continue reading(just kidding, keep reading if you want to).
* The project was built using simple algorithm called Minimax Algorithm. It is fast, easier to implement, easy to understand and more over it's based on using simple common sense based on winning logic of the game.
* We CHALLENGE you to win the game without changing the script. You just can't :)
* Take a moment and try to understand what we did here, we used simple DSA concepts and built something which is very good at doing it's task.
* We emphasize on putting in that creative side of the brain to work
* So, thanks for reading it through. Do check the website if haven't already.
* Stay home and keep rocking, peace.
